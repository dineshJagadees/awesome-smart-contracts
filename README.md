## Smart Contracts

- [0x](https://github.com/0xProject/contracts) - An open protocol that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of Ethereum-based assets. [:page_facing_up:](https://0xproject.com/pdfs/0x_white_paper.pdf "White Paper")
- [Bancor](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts) - A built-in price discovery and liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains. [:page_facing_up:](https://www.bancor.network/whitepaper "White Paper")
- [ChronoBank](https://github.com/ChronoBank/SmartContracts/) - A [time-based exchange system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency) built around a concept called Labor-Hour (LH) Tokens. [:closed_lock_with_key:](https://dapphub.github.io/chronobank-review/ "Security Audit") [:page_facing_up:](https://chronobank.io/files/whitepaper.pdf "White Paper")
- [DigixDAO](https://github.com/DigixGlobal/digixdao-contracts) - A proof-of-asset protocol that utilizes Ethereum and IPFS to track an asset's existence without a centralized database. [:page_facing_up:](https://dgx.io/whitepaper.pdf "White Paper")
- [MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao) - [:closed_lock_with_key:](https://github.com/makerdao/audit-2/blob/master/makerdao_audit_aug_2016_public.pdf "Security Audit") [:page_facing_up:](https://github.com/makerdao/docs/blob/master/Dai.md "White Paper")
- [Numeraire](https://github.com/numerai/contract) - An [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) token used for staking in Numerai's machine learning tournament to solve the stock market. [:closed_lock_with_key:](https://github.com/numerai/contract/blob/master/security_audit.pdf "Security Audit") [:page_facing_up:](https://numer.ai/whitepaper.pdf "White Paper")
- [Slock.it](https://github.com/slockit/smart-contract) - DAO and Universal Sharing Network (USN) to rent, sell, and share objects on-demand without middlemen. [:page_facing_up:](https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf "White Paper")

## Libraries

- [ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet](https://github.com/ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet) - Allows multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution.
- [ConsenSys/StandardBounties](https://github.com/ConsenSys/StandardBounties) - A set of standard contracts to be used as interfaces for any kind of bounty, either qualitative or quantitative in nature.
- [ConsenSys/Tokens](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens) - Solidity smart contract code to issue simple, standards-compliant tokens on Ethereum. It can be used to create any form of asset, currency, coin, hours, usage tokens, vunk, etc.
- [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) - A framework to build secure smart contracts on Ethereum. [:closed_lock_with_key:](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/audit "Security Audits")
- [Solidity Standard Library](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/std) - A proof-of-concept standard library that is included with Solidity itself.
